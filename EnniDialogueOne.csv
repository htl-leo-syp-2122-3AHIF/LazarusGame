She is asleep. Will you wake her up?;
Oh my~, I fell asleep! Thank you for waking me up.;
I should really head back home, I need sleep.;
But what division are you in? They told me that this is a solo mission.;
Just leave me here, I can handle this mission alone!;
Hmm? You don't know how to get out of here?;
There is a path ahead, just follow it in this order or you'll get lost.;
"LEFT", "RIGHT", "MIDDLE", "LEFT", "RIGHT";
After that, you will see the exit.;
Take care of yourself!;
