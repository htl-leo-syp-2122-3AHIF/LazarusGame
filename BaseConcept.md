You woke up in a cave in some kind of room. There is a iron-barred gate which slowly opens. 
A hostile snake creeps up on you and will work as the tutorial enemy on how to defend yourself.
You are now playing the retro-minigame ***"SNAKE"***

## SNAKE (minigame)

>Simple snake game with a few additional features:  
- Specific timeframe to play: 10s  
- You need to pick up as many fruits as possible in the given timeframe to mitigate the enemies damage.  
- Depending on the enemies base damage, you will have to collect more fruits to nullify the damage.  
Example:  
Damage: 4 AD  
Fruits until damage nullifycation: 4  
Player picks up 3 fruits in 10s -> Takes 1 damage

## ENEMY STATS
>Difficulty: EASY, INTERMEDIATE, HARD  
Talent: Specific porperty of an enemy which gives bonus stats (z.B. higher damage but less hp etc.)  
DAMAGE: basierend auf die Schwierigkeit des Gegners und seines Talents.  

After defeating the snake you continue through the canal where you have to fight more snakes. After some time of stumbling through the canal you find a sleeping girl with the same clothes as the player. If you get close to the girl you can either wake her up or let her continue sleeping 

## Decisions
>Waking her up:   
After talking a bit to her she gives you the way out of the canal "left", "right", "middle", "left", "right".

>Not waking her up:  
You continue walking without knowing the correct way.


## Out of the canal
After finally getting out, you meet a NPC at the entrance. After talking a bit to him, he tells you where to go next. The world is in a medivel style and doesn't look advanced at all. Even if you have a Goal you can still freely roam.
